# Modeling and Simulation of Vertex Models in C++

Welcome to the documentation of vertex models in computational biology.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Vertex Models

The chapter gives a brief introduction to vertex models for cell alignment.

## Chapter 2: Basics of C++

Here we introduce you to Object Oriented Programming in C++ required for understanding the implementation of this project.
